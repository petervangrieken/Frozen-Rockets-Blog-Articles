		<h1>Difficult doesn't need to be complex</h1>

		<p>About 2 months ago I had the pleasure of attending the Beyond Tellerrand conference in Düsseldorf and watching many great talks by Ethan Marcotte, Erik Spiekermann, Jessica Hische and others. The one that stood out to me, was Stephen Hay’s talk titled Maintaining Simplicity.</p>

<p>A great way to achieve simplicity and one of the key principles in his work and in this talk is the <em>Zero Interface</em>, the concept where there is no interface between the user and the goal she is trying to accomplish. Whatever the user thinks of, with the snap of a finger the result is there. Think Amazon 1-Click without even clicking a button. This hypothetical (and perhaps ideal) interface can help us reduce complexity in the interfaces we design when we remember that “<em>anything you add to the zero interface is perhaps one step too many</em>” (from <a href="http://responsivedesignworkflow.com">Responsive Design Workflow</a>).</p>

<p>I love this concept, because it forces us to make things as simple as possible. Somehow there’s a misconception that designing a simple interface is easier and takes less work than making something complex. It’s true that most complex interfaces are the result of years of work and new implementations, but obviously not a lot of work has gone into thinking and considering each addition to the interface.</p>

<h2 id="difficult-vs-complex">Difficult vs. Complex</h2>

<p>When making the distinction between something difficult and something complicated, I like the Marathon Analogy: Running a marathon is very difficult, it takes a lot of training and you’ll  feel exhausted when you cross the finishline, but it’s not complicated; Just put one foot in front of the other. For 42 kilometers.</p>

<p>If you have to do something difficult, at least make it simple to do it. This is true for running marathons and it’s also true for interfaces. I’ve worked on a project where the best regarded content managers were the ones who actually knew how to operate the CMS. It felt like a badge of honor to them. That’s just crazy!</p>

<p>As Stephen mentioned in <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/stephenhay/the-zero-interface-using-zero-based-thinking-to-maintain-simplicity-fowd-london-2014">his talk</a>: “<em>Simple doesn’t mean stupid (and complex doesn’t mean smart)</em>.”</p>
