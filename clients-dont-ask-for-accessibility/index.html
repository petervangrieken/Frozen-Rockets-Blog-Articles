		<h1>99% of my clients don't ask for an accessible website, they just get one.</h1>

		<p>Accessibility still seems to be one of those things most designers and developers don’t want to think about. WAI Aria is a W3C Reccomendation since March of this year, but most websites I see don’t use Landmark roles, let alone Live Regions. And somehow, many developers don’t even care about semantic HTML anymore.</p>

<p>I’m not sure if it’s just lazyness or that designers and developers see accessibility as an annoying constraint, but I guess it’s a combination of both. Just like testing a website in Internet Explorer is an annoyance, so is testing it with a screen reader. </p>

<p>For some reason making websites accessible is still seen as something you do for <em>that one blind guy</em>, but designing an accessible website means you design it for everybody. That includes <a href="https://the-pastry-box-project.net/anne-gibson/2014-july-31">your grandma who needs her reading glasses, a co-worker who broke his arm and your colorblind girlfriend</a>, but also that person who tries to access you site on hotel wifi. That means readable text, keyboard navigation, underlined links and a site that works when Javascript fails to load.</p>

<p>Although I have worked on several government websites, which are obliged to comply with <a href="http://www.webrichtlijnen.nl/english/what-and-why/regulatory">the Dutch Web Guidelines</a> (WCAG 2.0), most of the accessibility work I do is for projects where it’s not one of the requirements. Most of my clients don’t even know. Or care, to be honest.</p>

<p>I guess for many designers this lack of care translates to not having to care about it themselves. Most clients don’t give a damn if I use <a href="/adding-aria-to-this-site/">ARIA Roles</a> or not or if choose to make something a &lt;button&gt; or an &lt;a&gt;, so I see this as a opportunity to do as much as I can to make it accessible.</p>

<h2 id="doesnt-it-take-more-time">Doesn’t it take more time?</h2>

<p>Sure, sometimes. Sometimes you need to do some extra work to make sure an element is <em>hoverable</em>, or to do an extra check for color contrasts, but in my experience most issues can be resolved by just designing responsibly: using the correct HTML, picking a proper font size, making sure text zoom works, etc.</p>

<p>I know I lost years of my life debugging weird bugs in <abbr title="Internet Explorer">IE</abbr>, sometimes things just take time. I consider it part of the job. At least making a client’s site more accessible is a much nicer and more gratifying part of the job.</p>

<h2 id="alright-you-got-me-now-what">Alright, you got me, now what?</h2>

<p>These are some of the tools I use to make my work a little easier. </p>

<ul>
  <li><strong><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/accessibility-developer-t/fpkknkljclfencbdbgkenhalefipecmb"> Accessibility Developer Tools</a> (Chrome plugin)</strong>, checks things like color contrast;</li>
  <li><strong>VoiceOver (Mac)</strong> is built in to OS X and a great way to see how your site is read by a screen reader;</li>
  <li><strong><a href="http://squizlabs.github.io/HTML_CodeSniffer/">HTML_CodeSniffer</a> (Bookmarklet)</strong>, a nice bookmarklet to check different conformance levels;</li>
  <li><strong><a href="http://heydonworks.com/revenge_css_bookmarklet/">Revenge.css</a> (Bookmarklet)</strong>, this bookmarklet will make it painfully clear where your site needs improvement.</li>
</ul>

<p>Once you include these tools into your workflow, you’ll see there are many quick-wins. Just start picking the low-hanging fruit and you’ll soon be making better websites without thinking about it. So please, designers and developers, I ask you to stop making a distinction between accessibility projects and <em>regular</em> projects. If you make every website as accessible as possible, we all benefit.</p>
